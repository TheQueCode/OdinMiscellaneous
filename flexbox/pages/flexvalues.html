    <h2>Flex-values</h2>

    <p><span>flex: initial</span> Flex item doesn't grow but can shrink. This default value expands to <span>flex: 0 1 auto</span>. The item is sized according to its width or height properties, depending on the flex-direction. If there is negative available space, the item will shrink to its minimum size to fit within the container but will not grow to absorb any positive space available in the flex container.</p>

    <p><span>flex: auto</span> Flex item can grow and shrink. This value expands to <span>flex: 1 1 auto</span>. The item is sized according to its width or height properties, depending on the flex-direction, but grows to absorb available positive space in the flex container or shrink down to its minimum size to fit the container in the case of negative space. The flex item is fully flexible.</p>

    <p><span>flex: none</span> Flex item neither grows nor shrinks. This value expands to <span>flex: 0 0 auto</span>. The item is sized according to its width or height properties, depending on the direction of the flex container. The flex item is fully inflexible.</p>

    <p><span>flex: [numbers]</span> Flex main size will be proportional to the number set. This value expands to <span>flex: [number] 1 0</span>. This sets the flex-basis to zero and makes the flex item flexible. The item will be at least as wide or tall as its minimum size, with the container's positive available space being proportionally distributed based on the growth factors of this item and its sibling flex items. If all the flex items use this pattern, all will be sized in proportion to their numeric values.</p>
