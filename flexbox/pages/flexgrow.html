    <h2>Flex-grow</h2>

    <p><span>flex-grow</span> expects a single number as its value. That number is the flex-item's "growth factor".</p>

    <p>flex:1 means every div inside our container will grow the same amount.</p>

    <p>Adding flex: 2 to just one of the divs, that div will grow 2x the size of the others.</p>
