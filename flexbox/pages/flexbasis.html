    <h2>Flex-basis</h2>

    <p><span>flex-basis</span> sets the initial size of a flex item, so any sort of flex-growing or flex-shrinking starts from that baseline size</p>

    <p><span>flex: auto is not the default value when using the flex shorthand</span></p>

    <p>When the <span>flex-basis</span> is set to 0% (its default when using shorthand) everything shrinks evenly. Using <span>auto</span> as your <span>flex-basis</span> tells the item to check for a width declaration</p>

    <p><span>There is a difference between the default value of flex-basis and the way the flex shorthand defines it if no flex-basis is given. The actual default value for flex-basis is auto, but when you specify flex: 1 on an element, it interprets that as flex: 1 1 0. If you want to only adjust an itemâ€™s flex-grow you can do so directly, without the shorthand. Or you can be more verbose and use the full 3 value shorthand flex: 1 1 auto, which is also equivalent to using flex: auto.</span></p>
