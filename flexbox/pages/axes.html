    <h2>Axes</h2>

    <p>No matter which direction youâ€™re using, you need to think of your flex-containers as having 2 axes: <em>the main axis</em> and <em>the cross axis</em>. It is the direction of these axes that changes when the <em>flex-direction</em> is changed. In most circumstances, <span>flex-direction: row</span> (default) puts the main axis <span>horizontal</span>, and <span>flex-direction: column</span> puts the main axis <span>vertical</span>.</p>
